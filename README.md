# C-Project

**Project Description**
BasketBoss++ is a C++-based portfolio analysis tool that assists investors in analyzing a basket of stocks within a given budget. The application will offer both quantitative analysis and strategic insights for potential trading decisions. By leveraging multiple strategies, the tool will calculate key metrics and generate signals for optimal investment positions. The projectâ€™s core functionality will be organized into two main components:



_Analysis & Metrics
Trading Strategies & Signals_



**1. Analysis & Metrics**

_A. Fundamental Analysis:_ Perform in-depth analysis of the fundamental attributes of each company, including earnings, revenue trends, debt-to-equity ratios, and valuation metrics such as the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This type of analysis is critical for long-term investment planning.


Functionalities:


Data Retrieval: Utilize external data sources to obtain stock information and retrieve fundamental financial metrics for analysis.
Data Processing: Employ C++ data structures and libraries (such as Boost or custom-built classes) to process the retrieved data. Key financial ratios and metrics will be computed to assess the overall financial health of companies.
Data Presentation: Display a comparative analysis of stocks, highlighting essential metrics and applying ranking based on performance (for example, using colored indicators).
Associated Code: fundamental_analysis.cpp

External Libraries: Third-party APIs such as Yahoo Finance API or RapidAPI for data gathering.

_B. Historical Performance:_ Analyze the historical performance of the stocks in the portfolio, focusing on metrics like historical returns, volatility, and drawdowns to determine how these stocks have reacted to different market conditions in the past.

Functionalities:

_Historical Data Processing:_ Use data structures like vectors and matrices to calculate past returns, volatility, and maximum drawdowns.
Portfolio Optimization: With a set budget, create an optimized portfolio using Mean-Variance analysis to develop an efficient frontier, maximizing the Sharpe ratio. Libraries like Armadillo for matrix operations can be integrated.
Associated Code: historical_analysis_optimization.cpp

External Libraries: Integration with C++ optimization libraries such as Armadillo or custom algorithms for portfolio analysis.

_C. Correlation and Diversification:_ Analyze correlations between the stocks to evaluate diversification within the portfolio. High correlation indicates reduced benefits of diversification, and a well-constructed portfolio should aim to minimize this correlation.

Functionalities:

Data Collection & Analysis: Leverage external data sources like Polygon.io to gather historical stock prices and calculate daily returns. Generate a correlation matrix to analyze how different stocks move relative to each other.
Visualization: Use external libraries for plotting, such as the Matplotlib C++ wrapper, to graphically represent the correlation matrix.
Associated Code: correlation_analysis.cpp

External Libraries: Polygon.io API and C++ plotting libraries.



**2. Trading Strategies & Signals**

_A. Technical Analysis:_ Analyze stock price movements using technical indicators such as Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). This will aid in identifying buy/sell signals for better timing.

Functionalities:

Moving Average Calculation: Calculate a 20-day moving average on stock prices using rolling window functions. Flexibility will be given to explore other time frames for better analysis.
Visualization: Plot the moving average on the price chart using C++ visualization libraries.

_B. Economic Indicators:_ Evaluate the impact of broader economic factors such as interest rates and inflation on stock performance. Understanding macroeconomic trends is vital for making informed investment decisions.

Functionalities:

Data Collection: Gather historical interest rates (Federal Funds Rate) and inflation data (Consumer Price Index) using APIs such as FRED.
Data Visualization: Plot historical data trends using C++ plotting libraries to visually assess the impact of these indicators.
Associated Code: economic_indicators.cpp

External Libraries: FRED Economic Data

_C. News and Sentiment Analysis:_ Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge the impact of recent news and social media chatter on stock price movements. Understanding public sentiment can be beneficial for short-term trading decisions.

Functionalities:

News Retrieval and Sentiment Analysis: Use a sentiment analysis API to fetch recent news articles or social media posts and compute a sentiment score.
Visualization: Visualize sentiment score distribution to interpret overall market sentiment regarding the stocks.
Associated Code: sentiment_analysis.cpp

External Libraries: VADER Sentiment Analysis API



**Future Enhancements**
Refactor stock data and settings into configuration files for ease of use and flexibility.
Implement a robust risk management module to assess and mitigate portfolio risk, ensuring alignment with investment goals and risk tolerance.
Build a driver script to manage API invocations, starting with static requests and later moving to real-time streaming for dynamic portfolio updates.
Deploy the tool via cloud services such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to offer scalable and accessible portfolio analysis as a service.
